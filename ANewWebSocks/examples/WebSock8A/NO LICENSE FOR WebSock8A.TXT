NO LICENSE.

// No license, Why ?
// A "NO LICENSE" is usefull for the following;
// When no one is claiming AUTHORSHIP or CREDITS for the work.
// When no one is looking for accolades, tap in the back, "way to go ...", beer, you get the picture.
// Also you do not have to worry about being sued, going to court ect.
// For example, if you're helping out your community, it helps by not claiming anything.
// By not including anything about yourself, your name, nick name, web names, ect.
// Simply refer to the name of software and version, is ample enough to communicate effectively.
// This should help the newbies with learning a new approach to community support and not
// worrying about licenses. And most importantly, when wanting to help out, in a pure manner.
// A benifit of helping others, is that your helping yourself twice.
